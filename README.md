## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Sacha!

I'm 29 y-o, I use they/them pronouns and I'm a web developer based in France.   
I mostly do Typescript & Javascript stuff, and play around with Rust and Nix.   
I value user experience and accessibility a lot.   
Besides coding, I like [playing bass](https://www.instagram.com/listen.to.under/) and [cosplaying](https://www.instagram.com/praz_cos/).   
I love listening to music and drawing in my free time.   
I also am very interested in mechanical keyboards and coffee. :)  

_**If you want to support my work, feel free to [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/prazdevs)**_.
